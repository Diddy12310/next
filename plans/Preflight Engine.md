# Plans for the Preflight Engine

The Preflight engine will check the user's data model to make sure it is fully upgraded. If not, it will prompt the user to change their password, add a color, pin some apps, etc. For some discrepancies, it will automatically upgrade the user.

### Pre-request process

Once authenticated, the user will be prompted to a halfway UI. It has parts of the Landing UI and parts of the Default UI. Part of this is already implemented in the Sign Up UI.

1. The user must have a strong, yet basic, understanding of the interworkings of the Internet.
2. The user must understand and acknowledge the importance of security, privacy, and anonymity on the Internet.
3. The user must be a close and trusted friend of one of the core developers of Paradigm.
4. The user must agree to data collection for the purposes of debugging and tracking issues.
5. The user must submit up-to-date contact information to be accessible by all three core team members.
6. The user must not divolge any information about the platform without explicit, written approval from ALL three core team members.
7. The user must notify the core team of any information leak.

More criteria will be added to this list at a later date.

### Invite code user request process

When the user approves the core team member's beta request, the team member must generate an invite code. This will be done in the Account page. A form will be required listing all relevant contact information, as well as a short questionare. There will be several checkboxes stating that the user understands the risks of beta testing and are able and willing to help the core team members iron out all bugs and release the full public version upon completion of the beta features. If the checkboxes are marked without the user's permission, the core team member will be held legally responsible if any issues should happen (but rather unlikely, since the users being picked should understand such things).

### Invite code approval process

For an invite code to be activated, the other core team members must approve it. This will also be done in the Account page. They will be able to review any submitted information about the user and will be able to cast their vote to approve/deny the request. A user can be denied a request three times before being deemed uneligible to test in perpetuity, throughout the universe. They must show noticable improvement in their bug finding skills as well as their general knowledge about technology and the Internet.

### Sign up process

When sign up is activated, BEFORE the user sees the sign up form, they will be required to enter their invite code, at which point it will be sent to Relay to be validated. A response will be dispatched, if the invite code is invalid, the IP address will have two more chances to correctly enter the invite code before the IP address is banned. If the user made three legitimate mistakes, the core team member must notify the assigned database administrator to unban the IP address and a new invite code will be created. Once a correct invite code is submitted and verified, the user will be able to continue with the account creation process. Once the full public version is released, one can join the beta program with an invite code in the Account page.
